# Sedith's Advent of Code

My [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) implementations.
This is mostly (only?) python with minimum amount of dependencies.

The repo is organized as individual folder for each day of each year of the advent.
Parts 1 and 2 are separated.
An individual readme broadly presents the code.
